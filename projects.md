# Apply Deep Reinforcement Learning to Congestion Control
*Undergraduate Research*

- Employed deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as deep q-network and deep sarsa in the field of designing congestion control schemes
- Evaluated our rlcc protocol compared with state-of-the-art TCP variants like PCC Vivace and Copa utilizing the mahimahi and Pantheon platforms
- Publication: "Glider: Rethinking Congestion Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning"

# Pedestrian Evacuation in the Louvre
*Independent Project in 2019 Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM)*

- Analyzed pedestriansâ€™ behaviors in emergency evacuation considering the effect of crowd traits and architectural characteristics using cellular automata simulation, and developed the queuing models to detect potential bottlenecks
- Proposed corresponding policy and procedural recommendations for effective emergency evacuation management of large, crowded buildings
