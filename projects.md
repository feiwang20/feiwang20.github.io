## **Refining Congestion Control Online Using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Aid of Expert**

<div align="right">
<p>Undergraduate Research<br>
Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Toronto<br>
Sept 2019 - Nov 2019 & Feb 2019 - May 2020</p>
</div>

**Advised by Prof. Baochun Li and Dr. Salma Emara**

- Refined the expert control policy migrated from our target congestion control protocol in terms of code
- Redesigned the switching mechanism between the expert and the agent control policy, and enhanced the agent's learnability
- Built a RL congestion control environment with an asynchronous RL framework where the agent execution does not block the network sender
- Designed online training to speed up the convergence of the agent's behaviors after deployed in new network environment and improved its generalizability

## **Improving Emergency Evacuation for the Louvre**
<div align="right">
<p>Independent Project<br>
 COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) <br>
Jan 2019</p>
</div>

**Co-Leader**

- Developed a model using cellular automata simulation and queuing theory to analyze and predict pedestriansâ€™ behaviors in emergency evacuation in the Louvre, considering the effect of crowd traits and architectural characteristics
- Proposed corresponding policy and procedural recommendations for effective emergency evacuation management of large, crowded buildings
